# Exoplanet Detection Algorithm 🪐

Using the data collected by the Kepler Telescope around the property of Transit (a dip in star luminosity, potentially indicative of a planet passing by), I built an ML algorithm that can take this information and make a 95% accurate prediction on whether or not an exoplanet is circulating a particular star 🌟.
